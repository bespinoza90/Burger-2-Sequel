# Burger 2: The Sequel



The Sequleized Burger App is a web app that lets users create, update, and delete burgers that they have eaten.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
 
This app is not fully functional yet, still working on some kinks! So stay tuned!

Here is the link to the original Burger App before it was sequelized!
